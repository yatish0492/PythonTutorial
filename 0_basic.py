Is python is compiled or Interpreted Language?
    It is both compiled and interpreted language even though all say its interpreted language. In python the python file
    will be converted to Byte code and then that byte code will be interpreted. Like java we have JVM. similarly we have
    PVM.

    We don't see any class file in python while executing?
        Actually python internally does that. we don't see class files like we see in java.



NOTE: python is a concept, it has many implementations like 'CPYTHON', 'PyPy', 'IRONPYTHON' etc. most of us use 'CPYTHON'
        which is implemented in 'C' language.
