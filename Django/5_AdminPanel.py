Django Admin UI
---------------
Django template by default provides us a Admin UI as part of creation of project skeleton created by command
    'django-admin startproject django_tutorial_project'. this is accessible by - http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin


How do we create an user?
    We use command 'python manage.py createsuperuser' to create super user. once we have created a super user you can
    create as many normal user as you want in UI http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin after login using the super user creds.
